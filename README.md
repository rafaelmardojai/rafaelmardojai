### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer working on open source projects in my free time, mainly GNOME desktop related projects.

I develop themes to integrate popular software with GNOME, like [Firefox GNOME theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) and [VSCode GNOME theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/vscode-gnome-theme). I also work on nice native GNOME apps, like [Blanket](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/blanket),  [Webfont Kit Generator](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/WebfontKitGenerator) and  [Dialect](https://github.com/gi-lom/dialect) *(co-maintainer)*.

I'm a Fedora and GNOME user since 2015 (with  a dark past with Windows and Ubuntu ðŸ˜…).

If you want to support my work, you can donate me, [here you can find how](https://rafaelmardojai.com/donate/).
